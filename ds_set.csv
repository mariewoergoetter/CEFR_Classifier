And remmember they expect you choose the right time to go. If you are staying in a big sity, you shouldn't go out alone at night . It's dangerous. You shouldn't smoking in public. We don't like it. Also remeber when you visit somone bring small gift with you. If you take your children with you, you should control them. It's considered impolite to alow them to run and screm insid public place. When you go to store you should stand in line and wait your turn. It's considered bad to puch others. Fainally, we hope you enjoy in our cuntry. khawlah,"

B2,"The author starts saying that suffering from career path confusion is a common occurrence in life. Actually, he states that the average person is likely to change a career path five to seven times throughout their lifetime. He believes that if you're going through it a great way of avoiding blundering into the same predicament all over again is to match your personality and interests to a profession. He asserts that you should learn what jobs are best suited to your personality and interests and that once you have discovered what it is that would make you happy at work, you must go online and take one of the many career tests that are available to the public for free. It's a good book in general but way too simplistic."

B2,"Slaves of Money In the top of the Spring Mountain, there was a large, luxurious house, which was surrouded by a dense forest. Mr thorne, an elderly, stingy oil tycoon, and his daughter, Caroline, lived in there. It was a very ordinary day. Early in the morning, when people were sleeping, a miserable scream broke the pease. Emily, the maid of Mr Thorne, who sent coffee to Mr Thorne as usual, found him lying in the pool of blood, with a jewel-encrusted dagger inserted in his body. Rumors spread in the crowd, but almost all the doubt pointed to Caroline, the only daughter of Mr Thorne, who was adopted 20 years ago. She's a unruly, wayward young lady, but fell in love with a poor boy, which met with his father's strong opposition. Mr Thorne had even threatened to deprive her of the inheritance. Because of that, Mr Thorne and his step daughter fell out and became enemies. After the police investigation, the result beyonded all expectations. The murderer was not Caroline, but the young maid, Emily. She, who had an affair with Mr Thorne, killed the old man for the money. Poor Mr Thorne, lived for money and died from money. It seems that his life is closely linked with money. What a slave of money!"

As you can see the first characteristic (education) doesn't depend on you yourself. Surely education, commitment and honesty alone don't make you a leader, people shall follow you, to do that you shall be a good speaker and not least important a good listener. Leaders shall listen their subordinates, the leader is not the messiah who knows everything he is the one integrating the team and the best ideas usually doesn't come from the leader's mind but instead it is from the team player's mind. Being a leader who people revere and are in awe is not an easy task but if you work hard you can be one."

B2,"It was a very interesting conference, and I made notes about how to be a good leader. Firstly, it's crucial to have a good work experience on it, and be ready to take calculate risks. You have to be able to weigh up the pros and cons, and ready to make difficult decisions. Although sometimes it's difficult, it's always important to take your responsibilites for your actions. Secondly, you have to set up a democratic system of involving staff in decision. You must be willing to listen to others. Always take control of a situation and be good at problem solving without lose sight of the big picture. Finally, you have to be clear when you set the goal, and consistent on whatever you say. Furthermore, a good leader should be reliable but flexible and open to change when necessary. Don't worry to make mistakes, you learn from them."

Meanwhile, we see the cops at lunch, talking about their relationships. The filmgoer feels the strong solidarity between these colleagues who see the worst and have to live with it. Close to reality, the movie looks like a documentary. You cannot stay indifferent seeing the horror of some children statements. You also laugh at unthinkable moments. This great movie will hit you and that's why the cinema is useful."

C1,"Dear Mr. Smith, I'm writing to you, to suggest a new group of animals to add to the cards. What do you think about adding endangered and extinct animals? One option could be to have animals from different levels of concern, which might be sorted according to the categorization by an international organisation. Names of categories could be, for example, extinct, critically endangered and vulnerable. Because of being very popular to children, we could use the unfortunate dodo as a synonym for extinction by saying: Dead as a dodo! However, I think it would be a good seller, because actually everyone is green today, isn't it? I have already estimated, that we have the copyright for many of the animals, except the dodo. But probably I will find some pictures out of copyright. At least I would be very happy, if you would chose me for editing the new cards. Even it would be my first time, I think I have got enough experience from the African set. I am looking forward to your reply. Yours sincerely, Bill Baboon"

B2,"Although some greatest leaders are born to make, you can learn something from them and build up your own management style just as good as they are. Here are the materials. Dealing with difficulties Good leaders have a strong sense of taking control of the whole area and are very good at solving problems. They have the ability of weighing up the pros and cons and making the difficult decisions ultimately. Attitude to the future When it comes to goal setting, good leaders should have a clear mind. This way, they dont lose sight of the big picture. Furthermore, they are prepared to take calculated risks when it comes to big time. Attitude to employees Almost every great leader has a strong commitment to people and is prepared to go the extra mile for them. Meanwhile, they create a democratic atmosphere so that staff can make their own decisions easily and they are also impatient listeners. Personal skills To be a top leader, you should be consistent in your morals but flexible and open to change when it is necessary. When a decision is made, follow through it whatever the results might be and taking responsibility for your actions. It is absolutely foolish to think you know everything and great leaders are always willing to learn from others. Above all, being a good leader is not just saying, it is about actions to be made. So follow these steps and start to get on the road to success."

C1,"According to the first picture, a meteorite or an asteroid will clash one day with the Earth. YU55, the last near-Earth asteroid was discovered at a distance of 324,600 km in November 2011. Its pace was 50,000 km/h. An asteroid of this size could annihilate a whole country. At that time we were lucky, but experts say that a collision with any other asteroid or meteorite is just a matter of time. In my opinion, the third picture concerns our unsustainable lifestyle. There is too much environmental pollution and using up of our planet's natural resources. One day, it says, our way of living will have drastically affected the lives of the following generations. Climate change has already started, and prophecies say that ferocious winds and floodings will devastate e.g. New York City. Sections of California will disappear in the ocean. Worldwide, many people will have to leave their countries due to natural disasters and will have to settle down elsewhere, which will lead to overpopulation in other countries."

Unfortunately, things changed drastically in the last four years and organized crime made us, the common citizens, to be always cautious and to change all of our daily routines and habits. Looking at the bright side, it helped us to live in a more modest way and to take care of our beloved ones; in fact, our teenagers now ask for permission and report to their parents where they are and also the adolescents take care of them and their friends."

Nowadays there are a lot of single women and men, as a consequence of a divorce or for a matter of personal choice, but they are looked at with different eyes: single women are unlucky and necessarily in search for someone to support them, while men are independent and successful. In the traditional family gender equality is still far away to come: women are still supposed to do the worst jobs and take the most of responsibility towards children and daily duties. A lot of work must be done yet!"

The reason why I believe this is that my town is very windy. Most of the days of the year are windy and this is sometimes irritating but if we built wind turbines it would be irritating any more and of course the electricity cost would be cheaper for residents. I am sure we can afford to construct wind turbines as price for maintenance and construction is affordable 80,000. The government wastes quite a lot money on necessary thing and if they do that it would be beneficial for both sides for them and for us, citizens. In summary wind turbine is good as much as it is cheaper to install and my town is very windy."

B2,"Recently, in my country people are much more open minded. In my grandparent's age females usually couldn't go to school and had to stay at home helping to taking care of kids and doing house-works. People think having a baby girl is a waste because they are going to get married and leave the house eventually. Over the years, roles do change a lot in my country. Females have the equal rights with male no matter in going to school, working opportunities and in politics. Even though the gender defined is not that clear do male and female are real fairly equal in our society all over the world? it's still a question in every country."

Therefore, finding an optimized way of learning is a challenge I face everyday. To help me with vocabulary, I'm trying to read texts as much as I can, when I find some unknown word I look the meaning at a dictionary and write it down in a notebook or I try to discover it by the context. Although my vocabulary is increasing with this technique, I have to be more dedicated and less lazy while I'm studying. For example, turn off the tv, close the facebook window and study in silence places are advices that I would give myself to learning english faster. I wish to learn more about expressions too. I guess sitcoms and films can help me to achieve this aim."

For example, Armtec, a Brazilian company, has been developing robots designed to be used in several fields, which are named with typical names: Saci, Caipora, Mulata, Samba, Sucupira, and so on. I do like computers! I admire the way they do their tasks, sometimes acting almost as humans. We could say a computer is a particular case of a robot: they can be programmed and, in certain situations, they can control themselves. As many other cases, the increasing utilization of robots is controversial. On the one hand, is considered to be harmful - because sometimes it causes unemployment. On the other hand, it can create new job opportunities - usually, with better wages."

In contrast, up to 47% of the 18- to 24-year-old men purchase one magazine a month. 69% of the first demographic group prefer magazines to blogs, on the other hand, 72% of the second demographic group prefer magazine supported by extensive website content. As both groups are almost the same size, it seems to me that expanding the young men group is more profitable since the market represents $242 billion compared to $153 billion for the young women group. However, the estimated figures show that by 2025, the first demographic group will be sharply rising. In comparison, the second demographic group will be slowly decrease."

The song is like country with a little bit of pop, and the lyric is sentimental and homesick. The voice of the man is good, with good mood but he don't have a really big range (look, I'm not saying he's a bad singer but, he don't have a big range). The rhythm is good, but not enough to dance in the middle of the party or at least not for me, I prefer songs with more bit.

I know as I have a mother with the same problem, but after drug treatments and therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) today she has a normal life. It''s not easy, as I experienced in my house. It was terrible for me and my brothers, but especially for my mom. The symptoms started as my father passed away. She didn''t want to go out and turned in a very quiet and sad person. The times she went out, tried to avoid enclosed spaces as elevator and crowded spaces. When she could not avoid enclosed spaces, started to panic, sweating, shaking and some times she fainted. We had no idea what was happening to her and what to do. One day , talking to a friend about my mom, he told me about a therapy for claustrophobia called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I went to ckecked about it and all kind of treatment for claustrophobia. This technique train claustrophobe to control the anxiety by being more positive an rational and accompanied by a therapist in claustrophobic situations to be taught dealing with their simptoms as breathing techniques and muscle relaxation. All of these must be accompanie by a doctor that can recommended a drug treatment too. Buddy, please don''t give up your job because of that. You can fight against the claustrophobia. There are many ways to help you. I bet you can''t live as your father, changing jobs. Fight it back. Think about it. Monica"

Slowly he got up. As he opened the bedroom door a cool wind caressed his face. Stepping down the stairs he noticed that he was not alone. Carefully he entered the kitchen without making any noise. The window stood open and abruptly he understood. He let his eyes wander across the room, and there he was with the stolen goods. Without reconsidering, he took the jewel-encrusted dagger and stabbed the thief to death. A golden coin fell to the floor. &quot;You will never steal anything again!&quot; said Mr. Stringer as he wrapped the dead magpie in yesterday's newspaper."

She pushed the gun into my friend's stomach and began talking very fast about evil and consumerism. My friend was very nervious and didn't know how it could happen.

Up to now they haven't caught the couple yet. Since that day my friend Meg is scared to leave the house. She couldn't believe what it could happen in a normal day.

It is very important to speak with your co-workers and your boss about your situation. I think they will understand that it is too much work for one single person. Furthermore it seems to be very important for me that youll manage your appointments with a schedule-program like google calendar in the future. I made the experience that it is such a great help in my daily working-life. Moreover I believe you should rethink your social situation. It is outstandingly important that you meet some real friends! Not only your facebook-friends. Maybe you can find a sport-club where you will meet some people. Alternatively you can attend masses or movies with some old friends! But the most important thing I want to recommend you is to find a girlfriend. Go out and talk to some nice girls! It is main thing not to be lonesome! Your friend Tobias"

The Road Bridge at Argenteuil by Claude Monet , was painted on site and shows the boats on the river Seine . Impressionists use complementary colors, like orange and blue, green and red . Monet creates the moviment of water with small strokes of different tints and shades, he is focused on the studying the effect of light. Expressionist Wing : the two groups of German painters are rappresented by The Bridge and The Blue Riders. In the Blue Rider, Franz Marc was devoted to painting horses with bold and radical colors expressing primitive energy of animals. Cubist Wing : inspired by Spanish Picasso and Braque in Paris . Le Jour painted by George Braque shows fragmented reality and multiple viewpoints, with muted green, brown and well balanced colors. Several feautures of the same object are shown in the painting.

For each pin that is knocked down, the player gets one point. When all bottles are knowed down (&quot;strike&quot;) by a player, the player gets two extra shots.

Secondly, I have moderate views about politics in general. I don't believe in ideologies. I am a pragmatic and think the truth is between the left and the right. I will only make decisions based on their positive impact on the students' life. Third, I am a strong advocate of the direct democracy and will put in place a system where all paramount issues will be discussed with you in town hall meetings.

The police catch you drinking alcohol while driving, you will get fine around few thousand and also go to jail.

The characters and the plot are really funny! If you didn't see the first movie, maybe would have some jokes that you won't understand. Anyway, the film will be interesting. The last scene it's unexpected and you will probably think sometimes during the film &quot;Oh my God, the monkey it's from evil!&quot;. Got curious? Come on to see it! And won't forget your popcorn!"

Will they be inspired by mysterious music sung in an invented language? No. Not only is the invented language in Cirque du Soleil music unique, it's an interesting part of the performance culture.

I know she certainly didnt mean to offend you. Although Im not looking to give excuses, I did want to explain her reasons for putting her foot in it. Its just that, as she is from another culture and so new one in America, she hasnt got the idea yet about the culture. She was continuing to go on and on because she didnt quite understand that you were asking her to stop. I promise that I will never bring her or somebody else over your home without the special training about the culture of America in a way not to speak out of turn again. Once again, please do accept my sincere apologies. Margaret"

B2,"quot;Ein echter Wiener geht nicht unterquot; is a TV series that is unique to Austria where it was produced. It takes place in Vienna and the main characters are a local family of the working class. It was the first time a TV series dealt with these people. What I really love is the language used in the series. It''s not usual German, but it''s the Viennese dialect and, more precisely, it''s also the sociolect of working class people. There is a long tradition to use dialects and sociolects in the performing arts of my country, but before that this was only the case in plays. But not only the language was innovative, but also the topics which play a role in the series. First, it''s about the main problems of working class people, conflicts with other people and stereotypes about each other. Furthermore, political discussions, movements and events play a role, but not as topics of dialogues between politicians, intellectuals or journalists, but in so far as ordinary people dealt with them. Because of this fact and because of the long time the TV series was on air, it''s also a historically interesting document."

The economy here is heated, and there are a lot of job opportunities, but you need some previous experience. Prior to studying chemical engineering, I was in high school, and I loved mathematics, physics and chemistry, so the only thing I can imagine myself as is as an engineer. Afterward, after a lot of study and determination, I got in the university I wanted to be in, and it has been awesome, but now comes the hard part of the story, I need to get a good internship in a big company, so I can be recognized as a good employee candidate when I need to look for a real job. Ideally I would work in the production process of some by multinational company, that's what I'd love to do, but after going to so many interviews and getting a lot of nos I'm getting tired. And what makes me really pissed is that sometimes (or almost every time) here, instead of saying that you weren't chose, they just don't tell you, there is no reply, so they leave you with the hope and you'll wait for the call that will never come.%%"

Above all you're my friend, so here's a couple of advices to you that may help dealing with stress. - Be more effective as a time manager. It's wise to set up a list of important things to do in your job and prioritise them - Focus on what helped you to beat stress. It may be discussing stress situations with your relatives or friends like me - Keep sound mind in a sound body. Observe your daily regime and promise not to combat stress with alcohol. Boozing may become the only thing that makes your stress go away. - Try to be positive. It concerns not only positive thinking, but also learning to say 'no' when needed. - Be assertive but polite in communications. Just think about my advices. Best wishes, Vlad"

The world has changed and our vision of the future is out-moded. The college has to meet with the today's needs of the students to help them to face difficulties due to the financial crisis.

I have a strong desire to contribute to that evolution and I'm determined to find ways to solve these problems. I don't have a long Student Council experience but I know one thing : as a President, I'll do my best to perform the job and I'll succeed with your help.

The windows in the room where open, and everything was a completely mess. It looked like somebody entered in the house looking for something...and killed John. But even though everything pointed to, that it was a stranger looking for money. The police found out, that the killer was... his lovely wife."
B2,"Hello Guys, I would like to share with you all somethings that I learnt this week about leadership. Some people believe that abilities to be a leader are innate. Others believe that you can become a leader if you want to develop some skills. But I prefer to believe that you can born with some skills and you can also become a leader by your own experiences and education. For exemple, if are not a well-organized people you can learnt it. If you have not something that you think you need to be a leader, is possible to read, study and practice more about it or about your weakness. Nobody is perfect. The practice leads to improvement. And it is valid for leadership's skills and for life, as well. Have a good week! Diego"

Did you know that the sales of our company has been the top one compared with our competitors. So with that information in mind, today's presentation will be split into three parts. To begin with, I'll give you a outline of the history of our company. It was established in 1800 in the United State by Harland. Secondly, I'm going to talk about the changes there have been over the past five years. Our branches have widely spred all over the world, and the turnover has been rapidly increasing. Now, we have 1000 employees and the revenue has risen up to US$550million dollars. Finally, I'm going to talk about the future. We are looking forward to entering the market and serving more people.

C1,"When my father was young, he could buy things and goods using the quot;Liraquot;, the old Italian currency. Things are different for me because in 2002 the EU adopted a single currency, the quot;Euroquot;. The advantages of this unique currency are several, you can go to every country of the Eurozone without paying tariffs or changing the money in your wallet. Eurozone's countries can play hardball with powerful countries such as China and the US. The unique currency brought some disadvantages as well, for example, in my country it was hard for a lot of people to get used to the idea of changing the National currency, in fact, some entrepreneurs took advantage of this situation and raised the prices of their products. The recession made the situation worse and these are bad times for the Eurozone's countries. I think that Euro wasn't a good idea. Look at it this way,"

Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Give a frisbee. You are allowed to take two shots on each turn. Give a total of ten turns. Nock down a pin to score a point. Nock down all the bottles. Take two more shots and add together all the points. If you have the most points, you are the winner. Don't play this game on a very windy day!"

C1,"Frankly, I dont think that companies have a social responsibility  at least not more than every single citizen. There shouldnt be any advantages for companies that need to be balanced. Manufacturing companies that consume plenty of energy should have to pay the real price for it. In Germany, and probably other European countries too, that is unfortunately not the case. Rather, they are freed from an environmental tax that was introduced to turn our energy mix to sustainable sources. Besides that, theyre getting the energy cheaper because of their high consumption. Thats justified to avoid drawbacks in the international competition. Some people may therefore expect the preferred companies to engage in social projects in turn. Personally, Id prefer global laws that prohibit any form of subsidies, environmental pollutions and human exploitations. There are different development stages in the world. Every region has to set its own standards like its practised in Europe, for example. Furthermore, the EU should state some lower levels for other countries regarding daily working hours, the working conditions and minimal wages as an ethical minimum standard for joint ventures. What we need is a visible red line of exploitation. Social responsibility is primarily a political task.%%"

On windy nights people heard strange noises there. They thought it was a baby crying. But there wasnt a baby in the house. For years many people tried to find the answer to the mystery. Finally people said Sell the house. Mr Smith sold the house to Bill Gates. But the strange noises continued. After some time, Mr. Gates said, I think the noises come from the old apple tree next to the house. Its branches hit the east side of the house when theres a strong wind. He cut down the old apple tree. But the stranges noises continued. Move the house, people said. Wooden houses are easy to move, and Mr. Gates was a rich man. He called in some workmen. Move the house to a new place, in Part street he said. While the workmen were moving the house, they found an old box under the floor. There was a childs skeleton in the box. Many people said that the childs ghost made the strange noises. Rebury the child they said. Mr Gates reburied the child. But on windy nights the strange noises continued... When Bill Gates died, his son Frank lived in the house. Frank didnt belive in ghosts. Some time later there was a fire in the house. It burnt part of a room on the east side. Frank called in some workmen. Repair the room he said. While the workmen were repairing the room, they discovered something. In one of the chimneys, they found a wind harp. The builders put the harp into the chimney to make music on windy days, they told Frank. now its old and instead of music, it makes a crying sound like a baby."

B2,"I became aware of the importance of office politics when I was up for my last promotion. My colleague had spent a lot of time networking, and had become involved with some exciting projects. She got the promotion; I didn't. Obviously, she was more than just talented and sociable: she was an expert at office politics. By contrast, I work hard, but I'm shy and quiet. Of course, my personality and habits put me in a bad position when it's time for a promotion. Since then, I've tried harder to play the game. For example, I like my colleague who got the promotion, so I've been collaborating with her. Once in a while, I'll ask her for advice. Indeed, she's become my mentor. One of the things she's taught me is that office politics isn't necessarily a war. You don't have to compromise your ideals. You can achieve what you want without being deceptive or placing blame. Instead, get to know your colleagues. Show them respect. Try to understand their ideas. Chat with your boss. He or she can be your biggest advocate. Admittedly, I'm still sometimes uncomfortable practicing office politics.%% Nevertheless, it has helped me grow as an employee."

C1,"Mrs. Serina Nelson, the 36 year old wife of Dave Nelson, murdered her husband. In an interview she admitted: &quot;Dave was driving me mad. I didn't understand him.&quot; She told the police that there had been an argument about something and Dave was shouting at her and hitting her. According to her report it was not her intention to kill him, but to stop him from shouting. The next door neighbour of the Nelsons, Timothy McLure (age 28), said that Dave Nelson was an unstable man. His impression of Dave Nelson was that he was &quot;a bit of a Jekyll-and-Hyde-character.&quot; Timothy remembers many times when Serina came to him crying because of her violent husband. Therefore he has sympathy with Serina. In the night of the murder there was another fight between Serina and Dave. But this time Serina did not cry, but took a knife and stabbed her husband. Than Dave fell to the ground, bleeding. Mrs. Maureen Nelson, Dave's mother, heard the scream and rushed into the kitchen but it was to late: Dave was dead."

What motivated the crime is still unknown, despite the information that it had accumulated a list of people interested in his death, because his rude way of treating its employes and people who live with him. At the scene of the crime I could see a jewel-encrusted dagger with traces of blood. Possibly it was the crime weapon since the victm owned several brands of backstabbing. The curious thing is who killed him didn't lead the large amount that was in his safe. I'll have to study on the financial life of the victm, their customs, their enemies, their loves, their heirs, all I believe could be important for the investigation of this crime."

But I can't understand why so many people like watching reality TV and gameshows. I never watch them. I would rather watch more documentaries, which would give us more useful informations.

C1,"The whole question of CSR is a difficult one. There are powerful arguments on both sides of the issue. On the one hand, it can be argued that corporations owe nothing to society other than running their businesses, paying taxes and following the laws of the country. The job of taking care of society is for the government. People dont ask politicians to make products, so why should we ask companies to solve societys problems? On the other hand, companies have a big impact on society. If a companys factory pollutes the environment, then it should pay to clean it up. If a company hires workers, it should provide fair pay and benefits. Companies can also help the communities where they operate. After all, that community is letting them do business there. Its a two-way street. Personally, Im in the middle. I think a company has to follow the law and be held responsible if it does something that negatively affects people or a community, but I also think you cant force companies to do good. Corporations can be a force for good in the world, but only if they decide that its in their own best interest."

The other habit is the lunch .If that store is the nearest one and you can't go to another cheap restaurant what you can do is to prepare your lunch at home,that will save you a lot of money.You can go to the grocery market to buy your needs for the whole week and you can cook for a few days, of course you could skip one day and go to that fast food place.About after work habit you don't have to meet with your friends every day . instead you can bring them to your house and if you should go for dinner just try to avoid the expensive restaurants as much as you can."

I am very interested in that job because sport has always played an important role in my life. I believe I am a very suitable candidate for the position as I could already gain some sound work experience in that field over a period of ten years. Due to my job as fitness trainer I do not only have the skill to develop personal exercise programs for individuals according to age and level of fitness, but I also have been in charge of giving advice on the correct technique of exercising. Later, during my work as P.E. teacher I enjoyed very much to wake the young peoples enthusiasm for sports. If I should be offered the vacant position I can provide an excellent level of fitness, an outgoing personality and I am highly motivated. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, xxx"

The second one is also located by the sea and its history tells a lot, the problem is that it cannot be demolished it or restored . The third house is not located near the sea. It is a stunning apartment that can be used as a home or for renting. The last one is a wonderful villa also it located a bit far from but even though the view of the sea is still fantastic and the house is also an opportunity for investment.

Findings - For the 65% in Rio and the 20% in Shanghai, it isnt a must buy item due to several factors: Design; Size; Color; Material. - There were the 20% of personnel in Rio and the 40% in Shanghai who would buy while expressing satisfaction, no great enthusiasm was displayed- they thought it was ok. - There is a bigger potential market in Asia. Conclusions - We had not enough market research carried out before launching the products. - There are two general opinions: good idea, bad execution. So our productions just suitable one market, the other market need to launch a new product. - No recognition of the diversity of styles and tastes in different parts of the world. Recommendations - We need more research in what men want and need in an accessory? - Create a series of Manbag with the features: Design: more sporty / Size: slightly bigger / Colors: strong primary colors; black and white / Material: leather - Changes also acceptable for Asia market as research shows current design is acceptable but not a lot of enthusiasm shown. - Organize a new design group and a new sales local group in Asia."

After taking a look at my employment contract and requesting legal advice, I've come to an understanding. That contract makes clear I should be paid for overtimes and it doesn't state exceptions on that matter. Furthermore, the extra work was not result of previous negligence. Consequently, I should receive the money the company owes me for those weekend works. I am within my rights to sue the company for damages. Taking into consideration my longtime, friendly relationship with this company, I wish I could settle this issue out of court. I see it would not be good for us to go through a full legal process. Therefore, I hope we can reach an agreement and solve, once and for all, this embarrassing situation. Yours sincerely, Antonio Oliveira Project Manager"

Please find enclosed a budget outline including my income, expenses and savings per month. As you will be able to see, my finances should allow me to buy the house.

It is said that the owner of the chemical plant, a oil tycoon----Mr.Landry lives in the house. Nobody cares about anything the capitalist, except his money. Who dont want to be wealthy? Until one day Police cars beset the house----the house was quite luxurious, even the windows were decorated really well. Sheriff Thompson stepped out of the car, Whats the problem?  Me. Landry, uh, was found dead in his house. a police officer replied and showed a dagger to Thompson. Its also found besides Mr. Landry. Wow, a jewel-encrusted dagger! The murder wasnt in short of money, uh? Take me into the house! Thirty minuets later Obviously he was murdered, all his cash was stolen. said Sheriff Thompson to The Times. Well try to solve the case as quickly as possible Sheriff Thompson got in the car and drove to home. Where is the jewel-encrusted dagger darling? We are running out of money. We must sell it!

As a teacher, I can't bear this. Study English online need not to learning in the classroom, and I can study whenever I have time. So I decide to improve my English online. During the periold of this course, I would like to learning more skills about English writing, especially the writing of scientific papers. I also want to improve my oral English as I need to communicate with international scientist. I hope I can communicate with others in English very fluently. I also hope I can write scientific papers without too much difficult after I finish this study program. Sincerely, Your student"

Consumers were questioned with the objective to observe their responses about Manbag. Findings:  35% in Rio de Janeiro and 80% in Shanghai like the product but out of those, 20% and 40% respectively are less eager to buy it in a real sense.  65% and 20% respectively dont like the product due to its design, size, color and material used in it. Conclusions:  Enough market research was not carried out before launching the product.  Diversity of styles and tastes in different part s of the world was not considered. Recommendations:  Exhaustive research needs to be carried out in the respective target market in order to gauge the expectations of men while using the product.  We need to invest more in design, size and color schemes to capture the diversified target market."

The worst thing was that I lost my company benefits, including my medical insurance. My total income went from about $5,000 per month to almost nothing. I was worried about keeping a roof over my family's head, as I couldn't pay the monthly mortgage. Fortunately, I was able to borrow some money from my parents to keep food on the table. Now, luckily, things seem to be turning around. I picked up some part-time work last month, and I'm hoping to get a full-time job with benefits soon. Things are looking up!"

Because I want to improve my poor English for work related reasons. Studying online allows me the flexibility. I need I normally study during lunch breaks and then again for an hour or two in the evenings. I think it is very convenient for me. Then you asked me subject I would like to study. I think I want to study speaking English and writing English level . Because I feel my speaking English and writing English level are very poor. Sometimes our clients asked me some questions in English . I almost can't clear what they said. Sometimes they forwarded to me emails in English. I almost didn't understand it . I feel it is boring. Finally, you asked me what I hope to achieve with an online study program. I think I hope to achieve speaking English and writing English freely within one year. I hope to start my study online soon. Yours sincerely, Paul"

I knew they could have taken good care of me, if I had had any problems even health problems. Anyway, I had a very bad influenza after coming to London, so I had to stay in the bed nearly a week. I was alone and wasn't able to do anything. I felt terribly loneliness. I cried more than five hours. My mum phoned me. An hour later, my door bell rang, there was my mum's friend's daughter, who used to live in London. My mum asked to her to help me. She looked after me for a few days. I've been taking care of myself very well since those days. I call my parents every single days. The most important things are my family and my health in my life. The life can be too short. We don't know what will happen. I think no need to think too much about anything. We just need to try to enjoy our life. However, we have to respect to the others.%%"

C1,"In 1966, a dyslexic sixteen-year-old boy dropped out of school. With the help of a friend, he started a magazine for students and made money by selling advertisements to local businesses. With only a little bit of money to get started, he ran the operation out of the crypt inside a local church. Four years later, he was looking for ways to grow his small magazine and started selling mail order records to the students who bought the magazine. The records sold well enough that he built his first record store the next year. After two years of selling records, he decided to open his own record label and recording studio. He rented the recording studio out to local artists, including one named Mike Oldfield. In that small recording studio, Oldfield created his hit song, Tubular Bells, which became the record labels first release. The song went on to sell over 5 million copies. Over the next decade, the young boy grew his record label by adding bands like the Sex Pistols, Culture Club, and the Rolling Stones. Along the way, he continued starting companies: an airline business, then trains, then mobile phones, and on and on. Almost 50 years later, there were over 400 companies under his direction.%% Today, that young boy who dropped out of school and kept starting things despite his inexperience and lack of knowledge is a billionaire. His name is Sir Richard Branson."

According to those results, the majority of people have two or three TVs in their houses and me one of them. Children likes to watch cartoons most of the day, so they should have their own TV. I agree that people now watching more TV compared to five years ago especially if they are not working. Figures indicate that news and weather, movies and soap operas are the most popular TV programs in my age group. I absolutely agree with that. And it is obvious that the least popular programs are reality TV, game shows and talk shows. But to be honest, I'm not with that 100%. Some of talk shows are really worth watching. And, most of the employees prefer watching TV at night. The survey shows that most other women like watching funny moveis with (56 % ), romantic movies with (46 %) and exciting movie with (44 % ). For me romantic and exciting movies are the best. best regards. Rawan"

The researchers who believe in the existence of this creature believe that Big Foot is a relative of the Gigantopithecus, a giant ape which has been extinct for over 100,000 years. There have been hundreds of reported encounters with Big Foot worldwide, but critics ask for proof. Most of the incidents related to Big Foot involve a lone camper or hiker. The trend seems to be that there is only one person who sees the creature at a time. Critics find this a bit dubious. Supporters of Big Foot counter these arguments. They say that the person who sees the creature is so surprised that they are not in a position to take a picture. They also claim that if these creatures have been around over 100,000 years then they have learned to adapt and survive in this world, eluding humans. We are still searching for the truth about Big Foot. As time continues, we may find the answers.%%"

If I'm right here, you're always feeling heart racing, sweating, shaking and some problems with you breathing happen more than one times when you are in your office. So, you guess it, I must say you get a metal disease called claustrophobia I mentioned before. My psychologist told me, when I took a close friend of mine to see the doctor not long ago, a number of treatments and techniques are available these days for dealing with claustrophobia. So are drug treatments from a doctor. You need to face your fear and practice skills to deal with your problems. I belive you would be better in your job and your life as well.

That flat was in the block of flats, and the entrance was renovated: a new door with an electronic lock was installed. One day potential customers agreed with her to look at the flat and discuss the terms of rent. When they came, she opened the door easily. However, after they visited the flat, they couldnt go out for at least 10 minutes. She couldnt use the electronic key; it just did not work. She tried to push, then to pull the door, to knock and kick. Nothing helped until someone came in from outside. Such situation repeated twice, she was so angry and outraged. She even thought to complain to the manager of the building to fix the problem. Some day, when she was as usual trying to go out through that awful door, a neighbor from the first floor came to the door and opened it without any key, just pressed the button on the door lock. She was so embarrassed!"

A major reason I was accepted was because I was fluent in English. I think that the university appreciated that I am also fluent in French, my native tongue. After"

B2,"On this line graph from 2004 to 2008, the first think to keep in mind is that if the National sales figures were lower up to mild 2006, we are very glad to notice that, since the end of this year 2006, our increase of books sales has been bigger than it does in the rest of the world. We can see, with pleasure, that our country, always, loves reading if, however we can show in bookshops and libraries, valuable books either novels, essays biographies, or technical publications. Since 2006 we were fortunate, to have many successful tittles, I don't want to name them, but anybody could guess. These many successes with highest sales have allowed national book industry to recover his natural level. But it's often difficult having many exceptional best-sellers, so, since the middle of 2007 we can notice a sharp decrease, what, however, sounds to be slowing down with the arrival to the national reading people of these two novels that met and meets still a phenomenal succes. We are confident for the future. Good reading to anybody. This was the speech from Mrs Booking President of National Readers Association, on 22nd of May 2008."

It's easy in two steps: learn about your personality, interests and working style. Consider the activities that really uplift you. Learn what jobs are best suited to your personality and interests.

But on the other hand, the companies have direct responsibilities from the shareholders to improve the products and/or services while earning as much revenue as possible. The CEO needs to determine the balance between social responsibility and corporate revenue responsibility. In terms of CSR, I believe all companies can all participate in recycling for the environment, not only locally but also globally. Although papers can be recycled, let's think about how technology can help us not print 10-page documents everyday. Most documents can be saved as PDF on the computer's local drive and then shared into cloud storage. Instead of recycling papers, eliminating paper is one of the most basic things employees can follow. Other recycling is to have a semi-annual corporate E-waste collection, encouraging employees to bring in old or defective electronics. The collection can then be scrapped for electronics recycling or donated to local schools or charity for a tax deduction."

C1,"For the demographic group 1, the women between 15 and 19 years old, I find a few advantages for the promotion of our product. First of all, our analyze shows a growth trend in the purchasing power which will certainly boost our sales. Secondly, by 2025, the demograpfhic prediction shows that not only we will have a larger number of potential clients but also a faster growth. There are also disatvantages: generaly women buy less magazines and are more atracted to online exclusive content as copared to men. In addition, there are already another 6 competitive products on the market. This will make our entrance on the market more costly and our product risks to be just a fad. Thus I consider that we have better chances to promote our next big hit by investing in the market represented by the second demographic. On the one hand men buy a larger amount of magazines and on the other hand, they have now and in the future a bigger purchasing power. Moreover, the competition on the market is realy weak. So is on this market that I think we will have the chance to see our market share risingly rapidly."

B1,"Hello Robert, First off, I'd like to say thanks for your message and for asking me these questions. The subject I'd like to study is English language. The reasons for studying English in general are: It's a global language and it's very important to know how to speak English when you travel or communicate with foreign people. I also love English since I was a young girl. I always dreamed of being an English teacher, and maybe I'll have this opportunity in my life. These days I'm studying at two online universities. All my studies are in English. So, it's very important to take this program to improve myself as much as possible. As for online studying, it's more cheaper and active. Otherwise, I can't go to the universities or institutes everyday to gain knowledge. My life is hectic and doesn't allow me to do it. I think online education is completely suitable for me. I'm ambition, committed and patient learner. So, I'll work hard to meet my targets. Life is more beautiful with challenges and victories. Yours faithfully, Sahar"

According to the excerpt it is not uncommon to change career path five to seven times during a working live to find a jobs which best suites to someone. The author argues, that to avoid to do the same wrong job decisions again, it is necessary to learn about one's personality, interests and working style. I have to say, the excerpt is a good inspiration to think about own's preferences, strengths and weaknesses, especially if some one thinks about to change his career path. Beside this the author gives some helpful suggestions to ask the right questions and give the hint to use career tools to assist someone in his decision-making.

Suddenly, I was surprised to see Jessica deep in conversation with this young man Mark and while watching them, I had the impression that they would be a great couple. They exchanged telephone numbers and some weeks later they really started a wonderful relationship. And I'm so happy they did, because Jessica and Mark truly bring out the best in each other, encouraging and supporting each other through the good and the tough times. In conclusion their warm, loving way of treating each other is just inspiring. Now, please let us raise our glasses to our happy couple, Jessica and Mark.%% May your marriage be blessed with great happiness and fulfillment. Congratulations!"

I really liked how he gave a good background to the audience, because we were not very familiar with specific parts of the research. The presentation was clear and made a good number of references to other related works, helping to understand the weak and strong points of his work. On the other hand, one thing he could have done differently was the number of graphics presented. If he had given us more figures, I think it would be easier and fast to understand the most difficult aspects of the research."

C1,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I will give you my view on the possibilities and risks expanding into these demographic groups. The first demographic group consists of females aged 15 to 19. Research shows that 29% purchase at least one magazine a month and we know that there are already 6 competitive products available. In order to increase our market share we must not concentrate on blogs. If celebrities and fashionistas publicly used our product and set a new trend, it would make the sales go through the roof. If we increased our market share just little by little, our profit would grow as the purchasing power and demographic size is being projected to rise by one fifth during the next 15 years. Group 2: In the second group 47% purchase at least one magazine a month and 72% prefer extensive website content. Our research projects that the purchasing power of this group is expected not to grow significantly during the next 15 years. I identity a higher potential for growth of consumers in the first demographic group. Regards, Jasmine"

Because of the weather we had summer wheels - we never thought about snow. But when we had been in the east of Turkey , we had to pass the mountain range of Agra . This was the most scary way we had . It was snowing and snowing , we climbed up higher and higher - and unfortunatley it was getting dark. There had been no other cars, no lights ,a broken and narrow street and we couldn't stop because it was impossible to leave the road for a stop. Many hours later we reached the other side of the mountain luckily. I wish you all the best yours bettina"

The police was told by her neighbor, Timothy McClure, age 28, that Mrs Nelson had suffered from her husband's permanent verbal and physical abuse. He said that Mr Nelson was a Jekyll and Hide character. On the night of the stabbing Mr Nelson was sitting on a chair in the couple's kitchen. As they were arguing about their next vacation, her husband began shouting at her and even hit her, Mrs Nelson told the police. Then she lost her nerves, came at her husband and thrust the knife she had still in her right hand into Mr Nelson's chest. He tumbled and felt to the ground, bleeding. Her husband was later pronounced dead in hospital."

For me, it does not matter if the divorce is real or just a gossip, because this is not really important for anyone besides the couple. Let's to think about our own lives and try to forget what does not concern us.

B2,"As the executive team, we all think a lot about effective and innovative ways to prevent and solve business problems. I'd like to toss around a few ideas and perhaps propose some additional management strategies for some of the specific issues we're experiencing. First, I'm sure that we're all very familiar with Albert Humphrey's SWOT analysis, the management-strategy process where managers evaluate a project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). However, I'm also very aware that we haven't ever used it here. Perhaps everyone is just too busy, but I think we can really learn a lot from SWOT. What I'm proposing is that we try SWOT as we begin the Cre8or Software project. For example, what if we carry out a SWOT analysis and include it in the written proposal for Cre8or? I think Cre8or would very much appreciate knowing about the internal and external elements that might threaten their business, and which elements could be opportunities. There may be similar software already in development, or maybe there's a product that's full of holes that Cre8or could improve on. Second, we've been talking a lot about expanding the business.%% In order to encourage expansion, I think we need to develop a greater feeling of mutual trust between employees and managers. What I'm proposing is that we be willing to allow employees to take on greater responsibility;"

I must read magazine, books or newspaper every day but if I don't know the meaning of some word it is necessary to look in a dictionary the meaning of the word and learn its synonyms and antonyms. I would use more common words easy to understand and would try to speak slower. Sometimes It can be necessary to use my hands or images to help me a little more to express my ideas or say or spell the word. I wish to learn more the language and know how to speak correctly so I can visit other countries, have new friends and know others cultures. I know that I have to practice it every day and be patient with myself. However, when I make mistakes, I must ask my teachers be kind to help me."

This song is talking about how the small town turned into big city and how it affected his life. He thinks the changing is not always good and would rather keep it the same.

B2,"Cirque du Soleil, which is a one-of-a-kind circus performance. What makes Cirque du Soleil unique is that they make you feel like you're dreaming. The performers wear imaginative costumes and perform thrilling acts that you won't see anywhere else. And, although many circuses use animals, there are no animals in Cirque du Soleil. Apparently, they believe animals should be left in their natural habitats. Between the performances, the inventive music, the set and the costumes, it's hard to know what's best about Cirque du Soleil. It's the most professional, most sophisticated and most complex circus I've ever seen. Imagine this: You might see eight men taking turns jumping 15 meters into the air at any old circus, but will they be wearing cheetah costumes and have long, white hair falling down their necks? Will they be inspired by mysterious music sung in an invented language? No. Not only is the invented language in Cirque du Soleil music unique, it's an interesting part of the performance culture. The performers come from over 50 different countries and speak at least one of 25 different languages. But none of those languages  not even English  is spoken during the performance.%% I think Cirque du Soleil removes known languages from the performance so that the audience can forget the differences between people in the world and instead celebrate the similarities. If we listen to an invented language, or to no language, we can all be part of one world. We can focus on that dreamlike feeling."

It is considered impolite to allow them to run and scream in public places without supervision. 3. In stores and public officers, you should stand in line or take a number and then wait your turn to be served. It is considered bad manners to push ahead of others for service. 4.

He loves to champion the cause of Housing for Humanity, the charity that builds affordable homes for the poor, but I know something that many people don't. A good friend of mine also volunteers at Housing for Humanity, and she saw this singer arrive the other day to supposedly work on the construction of a new home. He arrived with all sorts of assistants and media people. He gave interviews to the local media and talked about how important this charity was to him. As soon as the interviews were over, he left. My friend said he didn't hit one nail! Granted, this guy donates a lot of money to the charity, but how hard is that for someone who is very wealthy? I'm sick and tired of celebrities pretending to be something they're not. This guy was in work clothes and had tools on his belt so the media would report that he was constructing houses for poor people. He has no business pushing this kind of image of himself when it's just not true.%%"

Your certainly struggled with physical symptoms like breathing problems, fainting, racing heart, shaking and sweating or psychological symptoms such as feelings of anxiety or panic, don't you?

Police have not released his name yet, not even to the press, in order to maintain the justice secrecy. There were many efforts to catch him on the last year, what included: extra police patrols in the area, undercover surveillance, publicity campaign by this local paper, and $300 reward put up by police for information leading to his arrest. But the reason he was caught is a lot different. A local resident called the police, because he saw somebody acting suspiciously, not knowing the guy us wanted for many crimes. Nearby police gave chase and eventually cornered him in Hamilton Road and arrested him at 6am this morning. He is currently held in custody for police questioning  charge expected by end of tomorrow - include interviews with detective in charge of investigation and a local resident."
A1,"Dear Mrs. Lewis, I am writing to confirm the changes in your house: I think you have to put a new roof because of the leaks we saw toguether last month. I absolutely think it's necessary to intall new wiring thoughout the house. In my opinion you could earn a lot of space if you demolish the wall between the kitchen and the corridor. It would be a very good idea to do acustic isolation for the studio. I suggest to replace the plumbing to be sure. It will be nice to refinish the floor too, it is very old wooden floor. All the reforms will cost about 15.000 but if you want to do only the urgent staff then it will cost 5000 (only roof and wiring). I recommend you to follow my advise and we can negociate the quote later. I wait for your answer, to start drawing the plans, see you wednesday. Teresa"

C1,"Green business is a way to use environmental friendly materials, technologies and renewable energy to produce green products. In other words, green business is a sort of activity which helps our society to conserve natural resources such as natural gas, petroleum and coal. Green business uses all type of renewable energy: solar energy, wind energy, water energy, even food waste energy to produce electric power. This process requires special equipment and modern technologies that is much more expensive than the process of using nonrenewable sources and technics. In my opinion, nowadays our society faces the issue of lack of energy. Our natural sources are running out. That's why we need to expand to use the other sources to produce energy. I haven't gone out of the way to use only green products yet. There is not a good number of green stores which have only green products in the area where I live. However, I try to pick the green products over the other ones if the other stores have them. I do it because I want to have my part of efforts to conserve the nature."

First of all, there is a quot;youquot; formal and a quot;youquot; informal, so when it is whether a first and/or a professional meeting or an older person than you, it is polite to use the formal one, speaking and behaving properly. The physical contact is mostly inappropriate if the people you talk with are not a part of a family. The big difference in an informal way is the physical contact. That shows the level of your bond with somebody else. When you meet for the first time, be kind of formal but warm. If you know the people, there is no chock in hug them for example. Most of all, at the beginning, avoid the hands signs. French people are used to talking with their hands, so you will learn quickly enough. If you have well understood, then I give you my thumbs up."

Although it may be a talent; some leaders have more influence than others. But, that my be accurate on the politicians level. So, it is very likely for a normal individual to learn and be trained to be a leader in his job. Moreover, the trainee would achieve a significant progress in terms of leadership skills regardless of his charismatic abilities. Should a trainee be talented as a leader, there would be a substantial shift in his career; his life may be completely changed as well. Personally, I have gone through leadership courses and found it extremely beneficial. Not only did I know hot to lead my department, but I also earned my team's trust and respect. They think that I'm the best manager they have ever seen; I was not sure about that until late. Therefore, the moral lesson of that story is: quot;never underestimate your potentials.quot;"

B2,"What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take me, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. I've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of the characteristics that we associate with a strong leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group."

For this I subscribed a site named Thinkmap Visual Thesaurus, where the synonyms are very interative with equivalent words. Also, I try to write words in small papers to memorize them, with a short phrase to show its use in context. I confess that I have some difficult to remember words when I need them. In my age group ( 68's age) I think it is quite normal. Sometimes, when I'm watching English channels on TV or listening radio I take a dictionary to help me. A good advise I would give myself is reading magazines, short stories, newspapers to increase my active vocabulary, to use new words when I'm talking about a subject. Finally, I wish I knew more about new and effective strategies to improve my English vocabulary. Can you help me, teacher?"

B2,"Growing up with my grandmother in West Java, Indonesia, I heard inspiring stories from the Wayang Kulit, which is our native puppet theater. Wayang Kulit is an 800-year-old performance art unique to Indonesia culture. The Wayang are flat puppets that are attached to a stick, different from the puppets that look like humans attached to strings. The puppeteer cuts exquisite, complex facial and body patterns into each of his puppets. A puppeteer takes weeks drawing, cutting and painting a puppet, but it's well worth his time. For the performance, always under a warm night sky, the puppeteer sits next to a cotton screen in front of an oil light. He holds his puppets up against the screen. The oil light streams through each puppet, creating mysterious, dancing shadows on the screen. Frankly, there's absolutely nothing else like Wayang Kulit in the world. Thanks to the puppeteer's expert control and choreography, the shadow puppets traditionally perform for about eight hours, telling the audience universal stories of life and death, and good winning over evil."

Did you think it's fair between male and female? 5. What's your opinions about discriminations? 6. Do you think what should we do if we meet discrimination? Discrimination can be direct, indirect, deliberate or accidental. If you feel you are being discriminated against at work because of your sex, marital status or gender, it is unlawful and your employer should stop the discrimination. We should protect ourselves from discriminating and ask for help from our government, law and other rights groups."

It's not my style, So, I choose to applicated your online study program, it's more interesting than any styles of education. I don't like Chinese, politics and history.but I like math, chemistry and physics. specially math. I sm so good at math. If I can choose three subjects, I will choose math, chemistry and physics. If I can choose two subjects, I will choose chemistry and math. If I just can choose one of them, I will choose math. The level I achieve to is better than now, I am only 12 years old, so I don't want to make a very high goal which I can't achieve to that, then what do I study this for?

B1,"Hey, A funny thing happened to me is a travell to Ningpo for 2 months.Bcause my mother's family lived there.I stayed in the suburbs. Before I returned to Beijing, I travelled from Ningbo to Hangzhou, Huangshan and Nanjing by bus. This journey was the most interesting journey I have ever made. The first stage of the journey was from Ningbo to Hangzhou along an extremely busy highway. We left Ningbo early in the morning. We spent two hours on the bus before it stopped for the first time. While we were waiting at the stop, I bought a fried cake and a bottle of yogurt. After we left the stop, the scenery became beautiful. I looked out of the window at rice fields and green mountains until the bus stopped again for the passengers to have lunch . After lunch I tried to go to sleep . But I woke up whenever the bus bumped or swayed . We arrived at Hangzhou at two o'clock in the afternoon after we had travelled for eight hours. As soon as we stopped , I walked straight to West Lake. Although it was not my first visit, I still enjoyed its scenery very much . The second stage of the journey was from Hangzhou to Huangshan. This stage was about 300 kilometres and took six hours. Huangshan is a beautiful area with high mountains and ever-green pine trees. There is a common saying that you would not like to see any other mountains after you have visited Huangshan Mountain. After I had spent two days in Huangshan Mountain, I caught another bus to Nanjing. This third stage again took about six hours and we travelled through some industrial areas. I stayed in Nanjing for three days. While I was staying there, I visited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, Xuanwu Lake and the Nanjing Changjiang River Bridge. The final stage of my journey was from Nanjing to Beijing by train. We had travelled for about sixteen hours before we reached our destination. I was exhausted when I walked out of the railway station, but I felt happy because I enjoyed the whole journey very much. Do you think it is funny? Dwyane"

Listing: Is like cluttering or diagramming, in this technique on the contrary of mind-mapping you put your ideas in a linear way. In the questioning, you don't look for answers, you look for questions to solve the problems, and to respond you use only closed answers like yes or not.

C1,"Dear John Smith, I am writing regarding a new idea about the cards. Our company could issue a series about endangered and extinct species of animals. It would be convenient and coherent to sort them according to different levels of concern: the vulnerable, the critically endangered and the extinct. I am sure that it is necessary to include some memorable famous sayings like Dead as a dodo. Furthermore, children could play Happy Families or some other games with cards. As far as I am concerned it could help to pique childrens attention to this crucial subject. I am convinced this series could be a good seller because nowadays everyone is interested in the environment and its future. I have estimated copyright expenditures for illustrations. They could be similar or less than our last product since we already have the copyright for many of the animals, which have been used in other sets. The last point that I would like to broach is the necessity of an editor. If you permit I could fulfill that function. In spite of the fact I have never done that before, I have abundant experience from the African and American sets. I will be waiting for your respond with a possible date of our meeting for discussing the matter. Kindest regards, Ivan Nazarenko."

In fact it's completely difficult to find people with so much freedom inside and even they feel free, is it that simple to find a new job? Is it that simple start all over again? This freedom I felt is really great and can help people to avoid stuck in life and start changing everything. But the book stops here, on freedom, on knowing ourselves. Changing life without a solid plan can be really dangerous. And I am not talking about a freezing fear, but about caution. It is good to motivate, but it is wise to say all steps and risks involved."

B2,"A survey was conducted about peoples attitudes to voices and British English accents. 5000 people in the UK took part. When asked, if they change their voice depending on who they are talking to, 81% said yes. The most disliked English accents are for 55% of the respondents those from the Midlands area of the UK. 45% named the Liverpool accents. The most of the 5000 respondents (72%) being asked for their kind of accent told us, that they have a moderately strong accent. 4% have a very strong accent and 6% have no accent at all. Here we have to mention that Standard English is still declared as an accent. When asked if they would change their voice if they could, 43% answered with a yes! (Maybe this survey could help a speech therapist to find some clients!) 60% like the Standard English accent most and 35% the Scottish accent."

Today, people have concerns about environment, are becoming more eco-conscious, and some of them are even aggressive to protect endangered animals. They are also enthusiastic to educate their children and children themselves learn about our environment and endangered or extinct animals in their schools. If we provide such cards with pictures of endangered or extinct animals, I'm sure many adults and children will be interested in them. Thinking about the cost of the cards, we already have copyrights of such photos and we can use them without any additional cost. So, I guess the cost could be less than or equal to our last product: Animals of the African Continent. Additionally, about an editor, I can be the editor with my experience of the last product and others. Thank you for your time to read this. I'd like to discuss with you in a meeting this week.

C1,"I think if you want to be successful, the first thing you need is defining your goals. Having clear goals is essential in order to achieve success. Your goals must be written, so they will look like a contract in your mind and you will be more committed to work on them. After defining and writing down your goals you need to develop a detailed plan. It is important to understand that your ultimate goal will be achieved through small and consistent steps. You can't think that you need to take a huge action to get what you want in life. You must start taking small and consistent actions, so you will get momentum and move forward your objectives. Another great trait you need to develop is resiliency. Knowing how to hold and turn around adversities is an essential part of the process. I also could talk about adaptability: the people who adapt faster are the ones who are more likely to get to the top. We are living in a world where everything is changing faster and faster. Being adaptable will certainly help you. Last but not least, take action. Don't be afraid to take action. Go for it!%%"

I think that catching the things you want without paying for they - or paying with a money that is not yours - is definitely not a nice conduct. I'm sure that you'll have a lot of oportunities to win all your objectives getting a honest job. You don't need to commit crimes for that. You're playing with fire getting into this. If I were you, I'd watch out my companies and would be alert with the advices people give you about having all you want in a easy and not conventional way. I heard about a lot of people who turned criminal having a behavior like the one you're having now. The saddest part is that the majority got arrested a couple of times and now they're considered unable to have a real rehabilitation. I don't want this to happen to you. Please pay attention in your behavior and don't mess your life because you want a new par of shoes. Take care, Camila"

Since everyone is interested in the environment and considered green, I believe the card will become very popular. In addition, we dont have to worry about the photo copyright issues, because we already have copyrights for many of the animals. For this reason, the cost of getting other photos is not expensive. Furthermore, if we really need to save the budget, I can voluntarily become an editor. Ive got lots of experience from the African set and Animals of the Americas. Lets do it! Best! Chili"

Instead of buiyng latte coffee you could learn how to prepare it using cheaper ingredients bought in the supermarket. Once you have to eat near your job at the lunch time, you should try to choose other restaurants with healthier food and accessible price. This could make a big difference in your expenses. I know it is important hanging out with friends after work because we live a stressed life nowadays, but you could think on change this routine. Instead of meet your friends everyday after work you could do that twice a week. Besides, it would be a great idea if you would decide to arrange a dinner at your home with your friends. You would spend lessa money and would be next your friends the same way."

I really know that advertising agencies are very demanding. Otherwise you need some days to stay with your friends, to do nothing or to rest. Doctor James told me about your high blood pressure. This can be a symptom of stress. You also must have a schedule of health life. This include learning to meditate, relaxation and change of behavior. Consequently you can recharge your batteries going to an hotel in the country. I know a very good one and I can recomend it. I used to get stress a lot. So the doctor recomended hypnosis. It was great and now I am feeling much better. In addition, I am attending a seminar on stress reduction. There I am learning how to avoid bad thought. This would be very important for you too.

This phobia includes symptoms like anxiety, sweating, breathing problems, racing heart, shaking and feelings of death.

I am in my middle thirties and after some both, quites and the last dismiss I decided to talk to a person I consider he could have been a mentor for me about my situation in that job: The Controller. He asked me if I had faced that kind of situation before and I told him that yes so, among other things, I clearly remember his words: 'Well, maybe is the kind of job'. I was not very convinced about his words but these days that I have had the opportunity to study and attend some music concerts I am every day taking conscious that due to my personal skills my real career path should have been: To be a musical artist, to be reporter/journalist or astronomer. I clearly know that because of the world wide economic situation there is no chance to start again, the important thing is make money before I get older and the prospects start to get less and less so, the only thing I have to do is continue with my current career path, do my best, get money and if possible, try to practice my real skills as hobbies."

By doing I find interesting senses of &quot;sister-words&quot; like love - live, lonely - lovely, monk - monkey, greed-greet.

When you want to visit a friend, you should choose the right time to go, because stay to late when visiting is impolite. Don't go out alone at night, it could be dangerous. You can't smoke smoke in any public building, because it's against the law. Here are somethings you should remember to do. You should bring a small gift when you go to visit some one. In public place, please remember to control your children, it is considered impolite to allow them to run and scream. You should always let ladies go first when go through a door with other friends. Enjoying yourself in canadian. Bset regards to your family. Jack 12.2.22"

Besides I have two children and I want them to have a place to live if anything happened to me, because I don't have a husband and their father can't afford to pay anything to them. I also would like to have more freedom to make some remodeling without asking the landlord.

Although the pros are to produce faster and preciser reports, which are suitable for an annual accreditation, the con is that we don't need so many medical technicians to carry out experiments. However, the hospital revenue is still increasing significantly, so we will not lay anyone off in the future.

In my opinion, more and more young generation avoids to watch the News from the network. I know there're much more regiona news and international news in the TV, but sometimes the guys prefer to reach the reality for a more widely area. And I don't think the old person like to watch the talk shows program so much. Maybe they intend to know the gardening and health knowledge programs more. As per the most kinds of avoid prorams, I forecast the Game shows will be the No.1 that because more channels only pursue the ratings so import some of program but without any creativity! Anyday the viewers will feel bored. Above is my pesonal opinion, I'm a female, so most of choice familiar as the survey result, such as I like romantic movies, camedies, soap operas, etc. It's really a successful survey, are you agree?

That includes my income and my expenses that I committed nowadays. I believe that I can afford this loan since my income is $ 8.000 per month and I am requesting a mortgage of only $800 per month.

I tried to think where the wallet was left, I recollected it was left in the taxi, and I paid the fee and forgot it on the taxi. What can I do to get back my wallet? I though. Then I went to Lost and Found Office at airport, I was so lucky, the driver of the taxi sent the wallet to Lost and Found Office when he found my wallet.

B2,"Dear Blight: I've heard from you that you want to buy a property on a Greek island,here are four properties that I selected for you. The cottage on Ithaca Island is the cheap, it comes with a bedroom , a sitting room, a kitchen and a brand new bathroom. However, it may need a new roof. The Hamilton House is located in Kioni, Ithaca, which has two storeys. The cottage is beautiful and has sea front. The Hamilton House was built around 1892, so it's a piece of history in Ithaca and attracts a lot of visitors every year. It takes about 1200 square metres and even has spare land to build another seafront house. Alough the Hmilton House is really old ,as a symbol of Ithaca,it cannot be domished. Then let's talk about the New Apartment. It costs 160,000 each and doesn't need renovations at all.It comes with a balcony and great view but the apartment is not very big. There have been many buyers invested in tourism. The luxurious property-villa and business is a wonderful opportunity to invest in the capital of Greek and it's a good holiday rental business. Forthermore, BBQ and telephone equipped. Take your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon."

B1,"In Russia, not a long time ago we got a new law about selling and buying alcohol at night. Back then, we might buy alcohol 24-7 at any open shop. Now, the shops can sell alcohol only until 10 p.m. and after 10 a.m. I think it's a great idea. There are a lot of people who have a problem with alcohol. In my opinion, the law can help to decrease the quantity of those people. Alcohol isn't prohibited at bars or night clubs. There are expensive drinks, and this helps the people to stay sober and safe."

B1,"Instructions for Frisbee Bowling A special area of about 8 metres x by 3 metres, where the game is played, is called the 'bowling alley'. Use ten plastic bottles as the 'bowling pins'. Fill them with a little water to make them heavier. Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Each player has a frisbee and can take two shots on each turn. Each player has ten turns in total. To get a point you have to knock down a pin. If all the bottles are knocked down, it is called a 'strike'. Then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together. The winner is the player who has the most points. It is better not to play this game on a very windy day!"

B2,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to buy the house I am currenlty living in. Firstly, I believe that it will be cheaper for me to buy than to rent a house in the long run. Secondly, I will benefit from the property building equity, from not being dependant on landlord and the sense of stability. Please find enclosed a budget outline including my income, expenses and savings per month. As you will be able to see, my finances should allow me to buy the house. In addition to the rent of $500 I am currently paying and my income, I deposit $300 into a high interest savings account monthly which can also count towards paying back the loan. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information. Yours sincerely, Jannik Schmann"

This is called Apocalypse, which is said to happen in December 2012,the ending day. Like the hypothesis for Dinosaurs, this one is believed to create at the same time earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tsunamis, wildfires, espeacially a great climate change that people can not get over and survive. The second picture represents a failure in resolving European's financial problems. Euro will be no more the common currency. There will be a change in Europe, either a new currency will be created, or Europeans will use US dollars. Whatever happens, it will be disastrous. The third picture with the Green Earth surrounded by the garbage represents a serious problem of discarding waste. Failure in recycling and in educating people's awareness of how negative waste influence our lives will lead to excessive pollution, unstoppable animal exctinction, and finally, incurable Earth destruction."

C2,"At one time, you became famous by being a hero, by doing something so unusual or worthy that it made the rest of us gasp in wonder; think of the astronauts who took those first small steps for man, those giant leaps for mankind. Fame of a different kind comes with the territory for the successful, the beautiful, the talented and, lest we forget, the notorious. Gossip columnists and tabloid hacks feed the frenzy of the 24-hour news machines we have created; increasingly the lines between the roles the rock stars and the mega-movie moguls play and the lives they live off-camera become blurred. Witness also the reactions when a celebrity figure passes away; people mourn their loss as they might a friend or close relative. Whether on the A-list or B-list, we have chosen to raise celebrities to the status of superstar or some would say gods, and watch in dismay  and sometimes delight, it must be said  when they fall from grace and off the pedestal the public, paparazzi and publicists alike have put them upon. People tune in nightly to see pseudo-news reporters updating us with all the latest gossip and trivia.%% Movie stars, musicians, politicians and even the captains of industry are all fair game. If life mirrors art, here we see entertainment gossip programs posturing none too piously as news programs, casting themselves in the image of CNN and producing edutainment."

White Space has recently been chosen to design Mishima Corporation's new HQ in Tokyo, beating other 100 participants and winning over Mr. Mishima himself. Mr. Mishima said he approved of the company's mentality and that their design for harmonious and efficient workspace was executed &quot;beautifully and exquisitely&quot;. However, CEO of Better Homes among questioning the company's financial stability said White Space wasn't up to the challenge. In response, the CEO of White Space appeared on the steps in front of the company's HQ to assure the audience of their capability towards the project and accused Mr. Lewis of spreading &quot;malicious and unfounded rumours&quot;. &quot;Since White Space was commissioned, by the Mishima Corporation, to design and construct the Sun Tower financial complex in Japan, it appears that the knives are being sharpened. Charles Lewis should be sure of his facts before making such outrageous and incendiary claims. If his intention was to infect my team with uncertainty then his strategy has backfired in a spectacurlar fashion. My advice to Better Holes is this: stick to what you do best. Meanwhile White Space will continue to do what we do best, buiding for the future.&quot;"

C1,"In the last years corporate social responsibility has been getting a big issue in public media and in the consumer movement. If a company shows social responsibility, it gives them positive attentions. But the company would be getting into trouble, if it won't have any kind of social responsibility measures and by accident a disaster happened like public mentioned child work or the workforce only receives starvation wages. This would call strong negative attentions and may be result into sales problems. So the risk for a company is greater to do nothing than to do at least something in social responsibility. I believe that corporate social responsibility is something between a rational risk management to avoid bad press and a strategy to foster the image as a PR trick. I dont think that companies are able or have the capacities to deal with morality. Perhaps the employees feel responsible for the social and environmental surroundings and may be they also have an intrinsic motivation to do charity work, but companies dont act on this level. They are looking for profit, but if social responsibility is translated into a financial terms, companies would be able to attitude in this way. Without any doubt, this would be important for our future.%%"

First off all I would like to tell you not to worry too much just relax, as people here in our office are used to foreign visitors. So, people in Switzerland are punctual, you better show up five minutes before the meeting, rather than five minutes late into the meeting. In a meeting we let other people finish what they have to say, we do not interrupt them. We also keep a quiet, appropriate and polite tone; we do not shout on each other or insult other people. We accept that other persons may have other opinions and try to understand there way of thinking. No one is leaving a meeting before it is over. We do shake hands for greetings but keep a reasonable distance to other persons; we avoid other body contact with people we do not know. Well, I think that is enough for now. Don't hesitate to contact me, if you have other questions. Best regards, Myriam"

This is an agreement that was signed in the late 1960s by five countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Since that time, several more countries have joined ASEAN, including Vietnam and Cambodia. ASEAN is mainly concerned with free trade and improving the economies of its member countries. Trade among the members has increased significantly since the agreement was signed. ASEAN also focuses on environmental issues like controlling air pollution and keeping the ocean clean. Almost all of its members have coastlines or are islands. The agreement also tries to promote peace in the region. The members believe that closer economic cooperation and increased trade will make war much less likely. ASEAN should not be confused with another acronym, APEC. It's"

I will make a big effort to get my English better and I will start having Spanish classes. At the end of 2012, I expect to have a good level in 2 new languages but not to be fluent yet. Also while I study languages in my country I will travel abroad on my vacations. I want start my international carreer in 2014, then I will have two vacations periods that I can spend in Madrid - Spain (to improve my Spanish) and San Francisco - USA (to improve my English) The other part of my plan is to apply for job at international companies after those two trips to be interviewed. It would be a great test. Finally, if I get the job, I will do my best to become a high-performer employee and in the short term to get a promotion or maybe to be transferred to USA or Europe. It will only depend on my dedication, will, and determination. I am going to be a go-getter person until I achieve this goal!!"

That's the reason why Century has managed to be one of the top three watchmakers worldwide. Considering Century's trend of working with famous stars, we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign. (Always good)"

I think I will need some advice about that choice. Another thing I want to travel abroad. I looks forward to learning about different national cultural and broadening the field of vision. The fourth stage of my plan is application for a chance of intership in an enterprise. That chance will give me more experiences and train my kinds of skills, for example, relation ?conmunication?planning and so on. Finally, I will look for a regular job in my home country.

In the first place you have to look for a house suitable for your taste and funds, sometimes you need the help of a property agent- but be careful: his profit is related to the prize for the house. Then you will have to contact a bank or several banks to compare their interests and schemes. Many people in Germany pay regularly into housing-schemes, if you did your chances to get a good rate at your bank are better. Important is to have some capital resources, either cash or in form of other properties or valuables, this will have a positive effect as well on the interests of the bank.

The rose to the last high of 27,499 points from 20,956 six months ago results in investments from Mainland China. Properties and Utilities Sub-Services have risen dramatically, due to the growth of China. One year ago the HSI started from about 20,000 points to at least 26,000 points four months later. But then after this sharp up, the sharp down came immediately. The HSI faltered to the bottom's line of 20.000 points and started its sharp up to the summit of now 27,499 points again. Analysts say, that this period will come to an end at the end of this year.

But in last month, I had to eat 'fast noodles'. and I thought it was very delicious. Last month, my husband and I went travling in Huangshan. It is a famous and beauty spot. In the area, there aren't enough water. So on the hill of the mountains, water is very expensive, and hot water is limited. We wanted to save some money, so we packed some bottles of mineral water from the foot of the mountain. I have been sick with my stomach. Especially I drunk too much cool water or juice. When we went to the hill of the moutain, I felt a pain in my stomach. Therefore, I was anxious to drink a glass of water. There was a convenience store on the hill. There were hot water to be saled. But if you brought his food noodles, a galss of the hot water was 15 yuan; if you only brouht hot water, you must pay 20 yuan. So my husband brought a bowl of the fast noodles and hot water. After a while, I ate the hot fast noodles, I was glad to enjoy a delious fast doodles. However, after we came back to the foot of the mountain, I ate a bowl of fast noodles. I thought it wasn't nice. It is a funny thing, isn't it? Best wish to you Linda"

Every morning he woke up late and we lose so much time. On one day the ship had problems with its engine and we wasted a half day waiting for its repair. Furthemore we did not see most of the animals they were promised and we had to pay extra charges  even if the leaflet said that the booked package includes all expences. I am very disappointed with the trip and I expect the refunding of all costs from your side. Kind regards, Michaela Hoppe"

In my mind, the reference to golf is the perfect way to express the extraordinary character of Century watches. They are to be experienced as classic, stylish and high-end luxury products which corresponds to how people perceive golf. The smooth stance of the golfer in the front reveals self-confidence  an attitude which certainly Century watches should express, too. The slogan &quot;Golf and Century. The perfect team.&quot; expresses that these two luxury things go together. As a result, the distinctive character of Century watches is underlined. For these reasons I am convinced that Centurys target group which aims at luxury will feel addressed by the advertisement and therefore will identify with Century watches so that our campaign will be a success.

When I hire him, I could see that he will do a lot regarding controlling activities, supporting the plant manager to be on track about his budget for the site. Delegating a lot to Franois on this allows me to invest time with other team members who need more help to figure out issues they had in their day to day tasks. I know that Franois does like his current job by seeing how is committed to the company, even when we have few peaks of activity such as budget period, he is always on time. To raise his bar, and after an open discussion we had, I coach him to improve his skills for planning activities. He is always on time when he needs to deliver actions but I think he is suffering too much because he does not plan his tasks on a schedule, prefer doing it last minute with stress. This is even more critical when he works with the teams as they need to know in advance what they have to prepare for him. Finally, I have no doubt about Franois's skills, he is aware that he has room for improvement on few areas and he is willing to adress them."

Your grade in the exam was 74%. Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a position as a computer sciences graduate student this year. We have received a high number of applications and approximately 20% of the candidates performed better than you in our admission exam, particularly on math and logic related questions. As you should probably know, computer sciences is a research field that demands lots of math and logic skills. Our computer sciences graduate program offers 40 positions every year so, I really think you should study hard this year and reapply next year. If you have any questions please contact me by phone. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours. Sincerely, Andre Lemos Computer Sciences Department Brazilian National University Phone: +########-####"

If you are invited to someone's house, bring a gift to say thank you. Soccer is like a religion here - You can talk about soccer, but there are people who don't like soccer. Say hello to everybody, smile. It's common men and women give two kisses on the cheek each other, but it is not common two men or women give kisses. Don't Never talk in Spanish. Don't say things like quot;graciasquot;. Talk about our poverty. Speak highly of Argentine. We hate them. Forget, the capital of Brazil is Braslia."

As far as my claim for overtime is concerned, my contract clearly states that I should be compensated for weekend work.

B2,"A murderer's wife Fulfilled with burning anxiety that made his heart pounding like the sound of savagely racing horses, he was hiding in the thight, dusty broom cupboard located next to one of the five bathrooms in his large, luxurious property. The eye-stinging, chemical smell of various cleaners and old soaps that slowly lurked through his throat down into his lungs made it even harder to breath calmly and stady. While tensely listening to the smooth footsteps approaching from the long, dimly lit corridor, Peter Walter cupped his trembling pale hand around his mouth to aovoid even the slightest noise of his breath. The air outside was biting cold and the sharp wind whistled quietly through an open crack of one of the bathroom windows. In recent years Walter, an elderly oil tycoon, was convinced that nothing could ever frighten him. Not even the financial crisis back in the 1920's kept him from being successful because to the best of his belief he wasn't an ordinary business man. Amongst top executives around the world he was known as &quot;the king&quot; who could even make profit from a consumed spouter and whose wealth was told to grow faster than the spouting of a volcano. But the sparkle which brightened up his life, got darker in the lifes of others at the same time because he utilised many people for his own benefits. His biggest victim was Charles Preston, a poor widower whose family was taken from the tycoon's company in a cruel act of violence. As his wife and children refused to give up their beautiful house and make space for a huge steely oil rig they got shot. Rumors accused Walter of being the mastermind of that murderer and tough he always denied nobody believed him as there were too many proofs against him. In the following trial Walter was convicted to five years of jail but because of being well connected and having plenty of money he could redeem himself. He and his wife Anna made the best of it and retired into private life. Though they enjoyed the glittering dinner parties, exclusive journeys and all the luxury they had, Walter felt lonely and useless sometimes but he would never admit. With every step his murderer approached the broom cupboard, Walter's fear spread in every single vein. He could feel how his heart pumped more and more fright in every corner of the body he always took care of and as soon he thought to explode from that awful feeling he got struck by something very heavy on his head. The last thing he glanced at in the few remaining seconds of his life was the dagger his father left him after his death. There it was on the soft carpeted floor with its encrusted diamonds sparkling like the timeless existence of the stars in the boundless darkness of the sky. With his eyes half opened he watched a thick, pure liquid running slowly along the silver blade of the dagger and when it reached the pinch and the first red tear left a tiny stain on the carpet, Peter Walter's heart stopped to pound and his lungs released the last flow of the chemical air out of his body. When he sad on the porch of his new property in a luxurious neighbourhood Charles Preston felt he had made a right decision. It was also a decision that changed his life in a direction he would have never imagined. Now he was a man of wealth and reputation, with a bunch of housekeepers and a new, beautiful wife. Anna never knew about Peter's murderer, when he killed Charlie Preston's family. And what she will never know is that when she married Charles, she would confide in Peter's murderer."

B1,"How to play Frisbee Bowling? You need an area of about eight meters by three meters. This is the&quot; bowling alley&quot;. There are no trees or hedges. You can't play the game on a windy day. Ten plastic bottles can be used as &quot;bowling pins&quot;. These you fills in with some water or some sand. Not too much. The bottles are lined up in rows of four, then three, then two, then one. Let's play ten pin bowling. Every player have two shots. One player is scored for each pin that is knocks down. If a &quot;strike&quot; is scored ( all the bottles are knocked down ), then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together. The winner is the player with the most points."

The robbers entered his car and forced him and his wife drive to an ATM. While one of the bandits got into the car threatening his wife, Mr. Valdvia was forced to withdraw money from the ATM along with the other criminal. After that the bandits forced him to go shopping using his credit card and they continued still threatening his wife. At the end of this kidnapping a fan acknowledged the player, he thought a strange situation and called the police. The bandits had planned his escape using another car that they had stolen that same night and they have managed to outwit the police. The bandits fled during the night but the next day with camera images were able to identify and arrest the crooks.

And then another interest thing is electronic cars. The change of cars will be inevitable in order to the delightful environment. I think that many of developing countries must have more frequently meetings with other countries to discuss about the pollution. That is very important to the people. I suggest that during the meetings, they have to figure out propriety laws for air and water quality. Unless they change their thoughts, the environment also won't change easier."

A1,"Dear Madam or Sir, Concerning the Sales Figures of the &quot;Manbag&quot; in Asia and South America we have accomplished a survey as requested. For that reason we questioned 2000 people, each half in two cities. So, we found out that 35% in Rio de Janeiro and in 80% in Shanghai would approve the new item, but only 20% / 40% were really willing to buy, however without great enthusiasm. It occurs that there are any different views among the people concerning the design, the size, the color and the material. It seems that not enough market research was carried out. Generally, it appears the item has been a good idea but was executed poorly, so far. Furthermore, the diversity of style and taste in different parts of the world wasn't recognized . So, before launching the product, we strongly recommend to do more research what kind of accessory men really want. Furthermore, the design should be more sporty, the size slightly bigger, the colors black and white, and the material leather. Please do not hesitate to contact our office for further questions. We look forward to hearing from you soo. Yours sincerely, Jens"

I want to start with a question: has any one of you thought we would end up here? Remember, five years ago, when Nadine first met Jrg as her new neighbor, they got along like cats and dogs! Asking for sugar was not even thinkable. But things have changed, they have changed, and it must be fate that made such an impossible couple a success. Look at them now! Has anyone of you seen a couple more in love? It is beautiful how affectionate they are with one another, how much warmth they show in every moment, no matter how dark times might be. As we know, they went through rough times, but they have always stuck together and supported one another. They have built a strong foundation of trust and I have no doubt that it will stay solid throughout the coming years. Dear Nadine, dear Jrg, I wish you all the best for your new stage in life. Everyone, let us toast to health, wholeness and future of our beloved ones. To Nadine and Jrg!%%"

The dinner came at the right time and again it was delicious. The fillet steak was cooked medium rare as I like it. It was also right sized. Only with the white wine there was a small problem. The wine temperature was not cool enough. This should be improved in future. After the very good dinner we did not have a dessert. Instead of this we tried your original Italian espresso.

A2,"Word games and puzzles are spoken or board games often designed to test ability with language or to explore its properties. Word games are generally engaged as a source of entertainment, but have been found to serve an educational purpose as well. For instance, young children can find enjoyment playing modestly competitive games such as Hangman, while naturally developing important language skills like spelling. Solving crossword puzzles, which requires familiarity with a larger vocabulary, is a pastime that mature adults have long credited with keeping their minds sharp."

It should roll smoothly from the very start, so you should not hear that very typical clonk that all beginners get when they are just starting. 'Look at the pins, not the ball: You should always keep an eye out on the pins when rolling the ball. 'Practice, practice, practice: If you want to get serious into the game, you should aim to bowl a couple of times a week. If you cant make it, at least once a week. The more, the better. The best way is joining a local club, where you will find skilled people who can teach you their secrets, as well as some newbies to play with. 'Observe the pros and model them: Watch bowling tournaments on TV and if possible, record it so you can watch in slow motion afterwards. Pay very close attention to their movements.

And another big pro is that it has a huge kitchen. No more crowds at lunchtime. I'll give you all more details at our next meeting."

B1,"To be honest, both the parents and the teachers only care about the diplomas. It is very easy to graduate from the universities, and this trend lowers the quality of the students. They only understand the knowledge in the books and how to get good performance on tests. In Taiwan, our education is not on the right track, and the people pay too much attention to the performance on the tests. I think that its wrong to judge a student by his or her grade on the test. Schools should help them to find what they want to do."
B2,"I love learning new things and I try to do everything I'd like to do. If there's one thing that I learned about life is it's never late to start life over. You should do what you like, otherwise anything you would do will be pleasuring. There's a saying that goes like quot;when a man do what he likes he will never have to workquot;. So, I do what I like, and if it goes wrong, it's just start over. Having this motto helps me to make things better and better, having no regrets and enjoy every single day. If there were one day in your life you doesn't feel happy on what you're doing, my advice for you would be quot;Do what you want to do, because it's never late to start overquot;."

As far as technique is concerned, a variety of techniques have been used. Brushstrokes are visible in parts of the sky, whereas careful lines and detailing have been added to some of the buildings, making the painting more interesting to look at. The atmosphere is oppressive, but also exciting. As for unity, the dark of the building and the light of the sky conflict, but the use of other blues in parts of the city joins the two parts of the painting together. The painting is similar in composition to many landscapes, but the technique is exciting and original."

Especially since she's helped us win the interdepartmental trophy twice now! In large part this is due to her speed and ability to run the length of the pitch without passing the ball to anyone so she can score another goal! She's possibly the fastest forward I've ever seen. Good decision-making skills under pressure. Sometimes puts off passing key information to co-workers or keeping up with paperwork. Can work well with certain members of her team but appears to have fallen out with one or two of them since the exhibition. Not always good at listening to other people's ideas, but often has lots of creative ideas herself. I wonder if we'll regret promoting her so soon."

Eating green food, using green energy, buying green products, creating a green roof or simply just recycling. It is very simple and it would mean a lot if everyone would try it's best. But I think most of the people simple haven't recognized how important the whole thing is or they simply just"

I am currently looking for a new job, so I can totally relate to the importance that having an economic stability really has in a person's life.

B2,"In the UK, even in this day and age, table manners are considered important. This applies even more when you're eating in a formal situation at someone's house. First of all, if you have any special diet requirements, your hosts will expect to be told about them in advance. Do not spring any last-minute surprises. Take a small gift with you: A bottle of wine, flowers or chocolates are all acceptable. Wait until your hosts begin eating, or they say it's okay for you to do so; this shows that you are considerate. Don't make phone calls or send text messages while you are at the table. It's considered extremely bad manners. When it comes to cutlery, the soup spoon is generally on the right, to the outside of the knife; the fork is on the left; and the dessert spoon is above the dinner plate. However, if you are not sure which of the silverware to use, you can employ a strategy I use myself when in similar situations: Watch what others do, and then do that, too. Good luck, and enjoy your meal!"

B2,"Technology is definitely part of our lives nowadays and I cannot imagine how would it be without all the resources we have. Communication was never so easy and fast in the history of the humanity. We are virtually connected to everybody all the time. The access to information is available to anyone, it is the era of the democracy of information. At the same time this is good, it also brings big problems. I don't stop working when I leave the company at the end of the day, because I receive several emails in my smartphone. My boss calls me anytime, anyday, even on weekends! We were supposed to be more productive with help of technology, but we spend hours just answering e-mails, instead of solving problems, instead of working. Yes, technology is important and useful, but it has also its problems."

C1,"A funny story to keep you occupied while stuck in elevators (true story): You'll never believe one of my brother's pranks in high school: One day, one of his classmates brought some dextrose candy to school. My brother advised him to hold his breath while eating the candy. Dextrose, he claimed, whereas completely harmless when ingested, led to an excruciatingly painful death when inhaled. 'Nonsense!' the classmate laughed, and to prove his point he took a piece of candy, held it to his nose and smelled it. I'll have you know that my big brother is a brilliant actor and a proficient master at spinning lies. He acted the part of the panicking, seriously alarmed friend so convincingly, that his poor classmate lost his confidence for a second. At that moment, the chemistry teacher entered the classroom. &quot;Is it true that you'll die if you inhale dextrose?&quot; he was asked by a now slightly worried, subdued boy. The teacher's deadpan response: &quot;Yes, that's true. But it takes a while, you die a little later. There's no dying during my class.&quot;"

He sorts important issues among many information, and passes them to us as soon as possible. Thanks to that, we can always share up-to-date matters with team members.

First of all, as a renowned TV chef who create the reality program to air in the fall of next year So You Think You Can Cook?, Mr. Oliviera has obviously done a great job on drawing the public attention on our modern food consumption issues. Moreover, he successfully raised the public awareness on the book Fast Food Fine Dining as the best-selling author. However, we would like to further doubt if he is really a caring celebrities or just a media-hogging opportunists. He seems to champions the cause at every opportunity and for instance once he joined Leave the junk out of your trunk TV ad campaign aimed at teenagers and their poor eating habits as an outspoken defender. Despite of his donation which is 10% of all income to this cuase, he allegedly wears corsets to keep in his ever-growing stomach which could results into our suspicion on his qualification on this promotion. Worst of all, he even endorses brand of sodium-laden chips sold across Asia. Isn't this junk food?"

You can tell them you need a place where you can escape quickly and easily, maybe near the stairs or the emergancy exit. This would help you not to panic so quickly and it'll make the situations for you less dangerous. In addition ask for a CBT it'll may help you. Love, Caro"

It was painted on site and shows the boats on the River Seine.

The lyrics is about changes (life changes and human changes). In other words, the lyrics make a criticize about the quot;improvementsquot; that transform the cities, the nature and the people's lives. The beat is other happy surprise, because Josh Woodward just plays guitar. Is the only instrument in the whole song. Both (the Josh's voice and his guitar) makes a beautiful partnership. Sometimes, Josh sing in low notes, but suddenly he increase his voice and there is a lovely change in the song. I recommend it to people who like a light song."

Another issue is the cost of living is going up rapidly and the every year the Brazilian people are paying more in housing and utilities, therefore is important to be thrifty. People are unhappy with the public health system because it is slow and seem that the government couldn't afford with this big national problem."

Due to the high amount of stress I endure every day, I find myself too tired to go to the gym. I also avoid cooking, so I often end up skipping dinner or eating junk food. I have no social life, and that frustrates me. Most of the time I don't go out because I am too busy working, but many times it is because I want to save money. I have a lot of bills to pay every month, so I live under pressure. I am not as happy as I used to be. I truly want to change my life. I don't know yet if my unhappiness is a consequence of my professional career or if it is related to something greater, but I do know that I am the only one responsible for whatever I want to achieve in life."

I'm a truly socialist, therefore, my formula is &quot;libert, galit, fraternit&quot;. I will convince you that for those who share my views I am the most suitable candidate. My program is not a theoretical one, I know what I am talking about because of the vast experience in social collaboration programmes that I had. Let me adress you the main issues that I will resolve. First of all I am assure that everyone should have more freedom in choosing subjects the really want to study, so I will convince our Principle to develop a more individual curriculum. Secondly, in order to support the poorer students I will create a fund into which everyone can contribute to finance educational trips for all. Last but not least, I will raise money for new desks and chairs. I hope I can count on you for support. Thank you."

The system of dual studies combines practical work in an enterprise with theoretical lectures at a university. These two application areas alternate in a regular rhythm. There are many advantages but also some disadvantages. The so-called dual students have the opportunity to collect practical work experiences during their studies which is appreciated by their prospective employers. The financing of dual studies is easier because students get a salary as long as they work practically. It is much easier to find a job after the graduation because the enterprises who have employed students will hire them later in most cases. What are the disadvantages? There is a"

B2,"All men are created equal. Why not all quot;human beingsquot; or quot;peoplequot; created equal? Women has less power and status in the past. Thanks to the Feminism and the movement of women's right, today we have a much fair society, but there are still a long way to go. Business women in my country do not have the equal rights with men. Usually they have less salary, even though they are doing the same thing as men. In a higher position, there are some quot;glass ceilingsquot;, an invisible discrimination, so women are rarely promoted to a influential role. On the contrary, for a man who is working among lots of women (ex. cosmetic industry), there's a quot;glass escalatorquot;. Men are easily promoted, with better job title, and higher pay. This situation has been slightly changed these years, but it is not enough. Feminism is a really controversial theory, the purpose of it is to destroy itself. For a true equal society, we don't need Feminism anymore."

B2,"'How to Make a Career Out of Courage,' by Judith Wight, analyses the aspects involved in a process of choosing the best career path. She makes it sound very easy. Would she be oversimplifying? According to Judith, the career path confusion is very common and we tend to face it by contemplating altering our career without proper analyse. She claims that matching our personality and interests to a profession is the key for success and it can easily be done. Overall, Judith's strategies are good. No doubt that asking ourselves what would make us happy at work and learning what jobs are best suited to our personality and interests would help us take some action. But, her considerations lack depth and fail to present any newness. This book may inspire the readers to take the first steps, but I think they will need much more than that."

We need to start using people who are more in the public eye. Perhaps pop singers or people on TV. I only have one request if you go with the TV option: no game show hosts!%%"

C1,"Dear Sarah, We've selected an ad campaign for First class dresses. I'm sure you'll love our choice of campaigns. Many people think that First class is a classic and well-known brand because it has featured some of the most famous stars in advertising campaigns. While this might be true, it is also true that customers prefer First class because it's simply the best and most reliable dress maker on the market. That's the reason why First class has managed to be one of the top three Fashion labels worldwide. Considering First class's trend of working with famous stars, we contemplated the idea of bringing a celebrity into the campaign. We decided, however, that the quality of the dresses was more important than celebrity endorsement. For this reason, we decided that the ad would feature a woman playing golf, simple and crystal clear but with a slogan that delivers an efficient message. A message not directed to stars and athletes, but directed to each and every woman that will read and look at our ad.%% Golf and First Class. The perfect team is a simple message that everyone can understand."

I know life isn't a rehearsal, infact I try to do better everyday. I study a lot and I can define myself as a responsible person, but I also know that I am young and so I ought to fun. When I was teenagers, I wasn't so responsible and I thought only about playing volleyball and going out with my friends. Subsequently, growing up, I had understood that I must study if I want to become professional. Thus, 5 years ago I stopped to play volleyball everyday and I have started to study harder. Now I advice everyone to think about what is important for them and what they must do to achieve it; because I think that feeling"

Hopefully, my investments will have performed even better than the expected 6% per year. Then my wife and I can travel around the world, even though the price of flights will have increased by 200 percent. By 2050, we'll have retired and bought a vacation home on Yellow Sands Island.

A1,"The Hang Seng stock market index is used to record the daily changes of the largest companies in Hongkong. Since one year, the index showed a greater volatility than normal. The world finance crisis caused the enormous up and downs of the index. The main reasons are the high market liquidity, nervous investors and bad news about the world economy and in particular about the crisis in the european union. When we take a closer look to the movements of the index within one year, we see that the index had started with less than 20,000 points one year ago. Within three months the index climbed to 25,000 points and plummeted rapidly afterwards. Six months ago the index started to recover again. By now the index has reached almost 30,000 points. That implies that within three months the index increased over thirty percent. This enormous short-run volatility isn't based on fundematels. Only noise traders, looking for short profit, can exhibit such a high index volatility."

After analysing the company contract and asking for legal advice, I am convinced that I am entitled to the overtime compensation. First, I would like to say the extra time was absolutely necessary to complete the project and meet the deadline and my supervisor can testify to that. However, that is not necessary as the company contract, in the article 9.7.4, clearly states I should be payed for weekend work at one and half times the normal hourly rate. Moreover, there is nothing in the contract that allows the company to deny to pay me for something that is not their fault. Therefore, I am within my rights to ask for the overtime compensation and I hope you reconsider your decision. Faithfully, Elisabeth Arakaki"

In this excerpt we may find several pieces of advice on how to determine which jobs corresponds with our personality and interests. In the first paragraph the author starts with a story about one of his/her client who showed physical evidence of being suffered from career path confusion. In the second paragraph the author draws our attention to the fact that this is a common occurrence in life and gives reasons behind this behavior. Later, in the last two paragraphs, he or she ask questions about what one should do to avoid blundering into the predicament. Fortunately, these questions have answered by the author, who gives us hints what to do to be on the right track.

Don't smoke in public places. It will be against the law. When you go to visit someone, you should bring a small gift. In stores and public offices, you should stand in line or take a number and then wait your turn to be served. One more things to tell you; no yelling. This is rude in Canadia and you shouldn't do this. Anyway, I hope you enjoy Canadia. See you next week! Charles."

C1,"Since my hometown is located at the ocean in a more or less constantly windy area, wind energy is the best way to generate sustainable energy. Electricity is generated by the transformation of wind energy produced with the help of turbines. The maintenance is not so expensive, whereas the production is costly, but in the neighbouring town is a big factory producing wind turbines, it generates many jobs for people in this industrially not very developed region. Because too many people living in the vicinity of the turbines complain about their negative effect to the landscape, birds and environment there is now the trend to bulid the turbines off-shore. Beside the negative effect on the marine animals there is still a problem with the lack of transmission facilities. Because of the pressure of the populace these facilities will have to built underground- that takes more time and is much more expensive. So right now we produce a lot energy but cannot transmit it to where it is needed- to highly populated industrially much more active region in the South of Germany.%%"

But it was overtaken in height on July 21, 2007 by the Burj Dubai in Dubai, UAE, upon the completion of that building's 141st floor. The title of quot;world's tallest buildingquot; still rests with Taipei 101, though, as international architectural standards define a quot;buildingquot; as a structure capable of being fully occupied. The Burj Dubai is on course to claim the title once its construction is finished. Taipei 101 is owned by the Taipei Financial Center Corporation and managed by the International division of Urban Retail Properties Corporation based in Chicago USA. The building stands as an icon of Taipei and Taiwan as a whole. Its postmodern style combines tradition and modernity in ways that make it Asian and international both at once. Its safety features enable it to withstand typhoons and earthquakes. A multi-level shopping mall adjoining the tower houses hundreds of fashionable stores, restaurants and clubs.

The beat with his acoustic guitar is very country like and happy but his voice fits more to a pop song. The mood is a bit sad and rough, not because of the beat but because of the lyrics. That's why I think the song is punky, too."

B1,"So far, I've never had a career plan, but I'm very optimistic about my future. I work as a freelance journalist and photographer at the same time. For this reason, I've always had many jobs to do in my city. I like to write and take pictures to newspapers, magazines or websites. Therefore, I'm improving my English to get some jobs as a foreign correspondent. I'm going to do everything possible to speak the Shakespeare's language soon, because I intend to send news stories from my country to the international media. After that, I will intend to travel abroad to write about science, technology, environment and take beautiful photos around the world.%% Although my job being so enjoyable because I love what I do, I'm making a little money nowadays. So, I've got to earn more and that's why I'm also thinking about to open my own family business soon, which could be a press office and/or news agency, since I've a large background as a reporter. In other words, I'll be a journalist forever even if I have my own company."
B2,"Last week I attended a presentation about marine ecology. I have to admire how the presenter grabbed peoples attention since the beginning. She welcomed the audience, and then she introduced herself confidently. One thing the presenter did well was give to the audience a brief map of her presentation. I liked the way she introduced her research to us. For each key point, she offered a suitable example. Her bar graphs and tables were self-explanatory. On the other hand, one thing she could have done differently was give more details about field and laboratory procedures. I think some people didnt have any idea about how the organisms were sampled and identified to species. Furthermore, I would have liked her to have given more illustrations of the species that she found. Finally, if she had summarized her key points in the conclusion, I think it would have been easier to remember the main ideas. Overall, the presentation was interesting and compelling."

B2,"When I was growing up, our reading was limited to the printed page. Digital publishing changed all that. People read on tablets, e-readers, laptops, desktop computers, phones and even wearable computers. Instead of carrying around a heavy backpack of textbooks, students can do all of their schoolwork on a tablet. What if you don't understand something in your digital textbook?

There is a lot of problems before I moved into this house. I outline these problems for you: 1. The lights is broken in the dining room and I can't see anything in the night. 2. The drains in the washroom is clogged. 3. The doorknob is fell dowm in the back door and I can't go to the outside. 4. The roof is leaking in the second bedroom and I can't stand it. Because I believe my landlord and real estate agent, I didn't have it fixed before I signed the contract. Now I change my mind and I want to return this house and have my deposit refund. However, they told to me that they can't refund my deposit and these problems is my careless. So I need you help and tell me advice about the problem. All the best, Eunice"

In urban areas this poverty is related to crime in different ways, for example the lack of jobs can lead some people to commit a crime in order to support their families. Argentina is not a producer of illegal drugs, however commerce of drugs and prostitution are worrying in some areas. On the other hand, it is possible to approach to the topic describing the legal and judicial system. In my country the punishments are very similar to other western countries. There is no death penalty and prisons are, in theory, oriented to rehabilitate criminals. Though, many prisons are overcrowded and some parts of the system are corrupted. As a consequence, many prisoners don't rehabilitate and become hardened criminals."

The song is one of Josh Woodward' s early songs and it has a light simple style with pleasant guitar work. It's different to a lot of his other songs as it has a lighter,smoother pop sound. The song describes America's consumer society. It makes a point about how buiding and rebuilding may not improve our lives, sometimes we would rather not change things. I like the song because it is smooth, original and professional, and this is not a negative point."

C1,"First of all, the choice of the TOEFL and TOEIC tests depends on the main reason of their necessity. They need as high level of preparation in listening, writing and reading as high speed of the assignments' implementation. Secondly, both tests assess the language proficiency. Moreover, TOEFL and TOEIC comprise the following parts: Listening, Writing, Reading, and Speaking. The tests multiple-choice questions must be fulfilled within limited time interval 115 and 120 minutes for 140 and 200 questions for TOFEL and TOEIC, respectively. I'd like to study statistics abroad; thus, TOEFL test would be more appropriate as it is developed for an academic purpose, while TOEIC is aimed at business field. The introduced scholarship requirements comprise score for TOEFL test at least 80. Thus, in this situation TOEFL is more appropriate one. Although, TOEIC test is also very reliable and its results could be needed in order to find a reliable job."

I have to admire the story she told during the opening. It made everyone laugh, and it was a great transition into the body of the presentation. Second, she looked at people around the room instead of just staring at her notes. She not only presented her thought but also noticed the audiences reaction. Another thing she did well was to summarize her key points in the conclusion. When I left the presentation, I still could remember the important points. However, on the other hand, one thing she could have done differently was to speak loudly; I think the audience who sat in the back might be able to hear clearly. I would have liked it if she had left more time for us to answer the questions. Overall, the presentation was very helpful and I learned a lot from it."

In the morning, she went to The Coffee Pot and came out with a cup of non-fat mocha latte coffee in one hand. At the same time, she carried her laptop in the other hand and handbag over her shoulder. As she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, she saw a yong couple get out of a car whose engine was still running and stereo was playing too. My friend was surprised when she saw the couple breaking the window with a hammer and throwing paint on the store front. When she wanted to stop them, the young woman who had vvery long hair pushed the gun to her stomach.And then, the woman began to talk very fast aboit consumerism and the evils of the modern world. During the time Meg was teriffied the woman was going to shoot her.Luckily the yong woman grabbed the laptop off her and ran off the street without shooting her. Then A nice handsome guy caught her hair which turns out to be a wig. And the woman was a teenage boy. At the moment the couple escaped and haven't been caught yet. Meg was scared to leave the house. She said it had been her most terrifying day of life. All the above is the summary of her story. Shuang Lue 2012.8.11"

B1,"hey, I'm fine. thank you for asking me. It's nice to hear from you. lately, I was bussy on this semester on final exams. I have read you email and your trip experience. It was very interesting story. I had college trip in the middle forest in south africa and there was campsit near from the lake. It was really great time. when I was there I took look around in this place and I went so far from the campsite. Then, I had realized I lost while it was raining. So, I thought it's better to find place to hide from the rain. I stood under big tree cover myself from the rain but I saw ahouse, it was very near from me. I had ran when was raining to the house. I had reached this house and I knocked the door but no answer, I knocked again but still no answer. So, I decied to leave but in that moment an old man came to the door and asked me if I need some help. I explain to him what did happen withe me. He was very friendly but in the same time he was calm that make hime weird person. he was alone in a house and the house was very historical. He brought me some cup of tea and we talked a little bit. I was very tired, so I took a nap on the couch. when I wake up, I looked around but there nobody there. I was trying thank an old man but I thought he left to do somthing, so I had left the house. When I was walking I met a farmer. I asked him about Route to campsite and I asked him if he know the old man. He had shocked and surprised to hear from about this old man. He told me the old man had died before fifty years ago. In that time, my body has freezed and I was scared to death. when he saw me like this, he took me by his car to the campsite and when arrived there I told story to my friends but no one believed me. It was really scary experience. So, tell me do you belive me? &quot;Imaginary story&quot;"

The Mishima Corporation case had been a great example of our perseverance and unmatched performance. When we won a competition against 100 others companies. According to Mr Mishima opnion, publicly expressed, we have gained due to the excellent design. We are certain that Mr Mishima will want our modern and exotic style, it would be a misconception to think we will not be chosen by him to make it. There is no a &quot;Best Home&quot; in this competition, there is a Best HQ, then I can't be affected by declarations that sounds like a bee around a capped honey pot.

B2,"If there is a lesson that I have learned about life is that it is full of surprises. It doesn't matter how organized you are, unexpected things will happen and they might change the plans you once made to your life. Because of that, I consider adaptability an essential skill nowadays. How fast and well a person can adapt to a new situation often determines whether she is going to be successful or not. I try to keep a balanced life, although sometimes it can be difficult. Whenever I see myself in a tough situation, I try to relax and find peace in the middle of the chaos. If I could give an advice to others, I would tell them not to worry so much about things. In the end, what matters is how we live and interact with people. Things can disappear, but memories stay with us forever."

B2,"Dear Lan, I have heard that you have tendered resignation to the manager because of your phobia of enclosed spaces. I am sorry to hear that and I understand your feeling all the time, but I strongly disagree with your option. You have other better options. To tell you the truth, I was a claustrophobe two years ago. I was scared of being trapped, unable to escape from an enclosed area such as elevator, subway or even WC room. When I was in those areas, my heart started racing and I began sweating. The feeling that the situation was dangerous and distressing controlled me deathly. However, with the help of doctors and my efforts I have overcome my claustrophobia completely. There are a number of treatments and techniques available for dealing with this phobia. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can train your mind towards a more positive and rational way of thinking. Therapist can help you gradually get used to the enclosed spaces and you will become confident in yourself. You may also be taught how to deal with symptoms. Breathing deeply and slowly, muscle relaxation or medication can be used to help you during a panic attack or any period of anxiety. Cheer up please! There is no phobia running in you blood. You can get rid of claustrophobia successfully and meanwhile do your work well. Hope we can have a chat this weekend! Yours George"

C1,first of all two demographic groups are compared. On the one hand side we see men are invoved in the process of reding more than women are. But on the other side people prefer reading by extensive website and blogs rather than knowing information through the magazines. As far as competition is concerned demographic group 1 has 6 competitive products exist on the contrast group 2which has 1 long term and 2 recent competitive products. Furthermore by 2010 the purchasing power of demographic group2 will have reached 242$ billion. It is $89 billions more than demographic group1.
